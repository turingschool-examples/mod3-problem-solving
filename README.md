# Mod 3 Problem Solving

This repo contains a series of test suites for some interview-prep problem solving. 

## To Start:
Take 10 minutes to read this [article](https://medium.com/@thatPamIAm/become-a-better-problem-solver-74dc48e509ab) on breaking down problems. 

## Instructions:
Below are a series of code sandboxes with code challenge prompts in them. Our goal for this morning is not to solve every problem, but to examine how we _approach_ solving the problems. 

For each problem, you'll start by answering these questions / following these steps:

1. What is the problem asking?
2. What steps do I need to take to find the answer?
3. Pseudocode out the steps to solve the problem.
4. Try and code a solution
5. (As you're coding:) What steps do I recognize, but don't know how to perform? How can I resolve that?

## Problems:

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/@kaylaewood/codechallenge-minmaxsum">Min Max Sum</a>
2. <a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/@kaylaewood/codingchallenge-indexsum">Index Sum</a>
3. <a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/@kaylaewood/codechallenge-bracketlinter">Bracket Linter<a>
3. <a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/@kaylaewood/codechallenge-robottraversal">Robot Traversal<a>

## Take Home Challenge:
  
  This is an optional take home challenge that we've tried to give them sometime after the mid mod. It is an exact copy of a take home challenge that Scott received, and was given a week to complete. The first few innings we've given this, not many students have found or made the time to complete it, so we're still evaluating if/when to give this to them.
